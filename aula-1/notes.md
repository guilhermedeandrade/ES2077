# Integration with JS tooling

During the class, the instructor went through everything that was needed to setup a Reason project from scratch.
Not only that, but also a project that supports React.

Based on that I created the [Miminal Reason React](https://github.com/guilhermedeandrade/minimal-reason-react) template.
This is going to help me or anything else who wants a really minimalist ReasonReact with to play around with.
